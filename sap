I have created a custom screen with a 1001 window popup where I added three buttons for country selection: US, Canada, and MX. The US and Canada buttons were already linked to existing logic, so I retained those functionalities as they were. For the MX button, there was no predefined logic, so I implemented a new functionality specifically for handling the MX country scenario. This ensured that the popup supports all three countries seamlessly while maintaining the existing logic for US and Canada and extending the functionality to include MX."
